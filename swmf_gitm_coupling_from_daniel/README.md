# GITM-SWMF Coupling
These files are for developing and testing updated GITM-SWMF coupling,
including one-way SWMF->GITM coupling.

## Files for Steady State Creation
GITM requires a good steady state solution once we transition to a storm event.
The folder "createSS" create a very simple steady state/quiet time solution
that can be used for other events.

These files are for GITM-standalone; the resulting restart can be used in
other simulations.

## Idealized Simulation Files
A super simple idealized simulation is provided to test coupling, including
the impact of the neutral wind dynamo on FACs.

## LWS Coupling
These are files for the LWS-GIC project where we evaluate the role of the
thermosphere in the development of ground magnetic disturbances.
